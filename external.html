    Comming back to the topic.</p>

    <h2>This is External CSS</h2>
    <p>I have added the Css externally by creating a separate file within the same directory with .css extension. <br />
    In the Css file you can style the web page using selector attribute and so on using the curly braces too before the selector same as in internal css.
<br />
Basically, <br />
inline-css is used for the elements <br />
internal-css is used for one webpage. <br />
external-css is used for mutilpe webpages.</p>
